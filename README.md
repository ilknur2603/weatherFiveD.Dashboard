# weatherFiveD.Dashboard :snowman: :sunny: :umbrella:

Hi I'm ILKNUR üëã

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

The purpose of this project is to make a weather application using the https://api.openweathermap.org api.It is to bring and display the weather conditions of the location desired by the user.
